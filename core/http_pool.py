"""Thread-local HTTPS connection pool using only the Python standard library.

Why this exists
---------------
``urllib.request.urlopen`` does **not** reuse connections. Every call performs
a fresh TCP handshake + TLS handshake. For a typical game translation run
(~600 API calls), that is ~90 s of wasted cold-start time.

Design
------
- One ``http.client.HTTPSConnection`` is cached per thread in ``threading.local()``.
- A single SSL context is shared across threads (``ssl.create_default_context``
  is thread-safe per CPython docs).
- On transport-level failure (keep-alive timeout, peer reset, broken pipe),
  the connection is dropped and the request retries **once** on a fresh
  connection before giving up.
- HTTP-level errors (4xx / 5xx) are raised as ``urllib.error.HTTPError`` so
  that callers who already handle that exception (notably ``APIClient._call_api``)
  keep working unchanged.

Only HTTPS is supported. Callers using plain HTTP endpoints should fall back
to ``urllib.request.urlopen``.

Pure standard library — no third-party dependencies.

    limit is hit promptly on hostile streams without stalling normal use.

    Raises ``ResponseTooLarge`` once cumulative bytes would exceed ``limit``.

    Round 53 monitor item #2 (precision tightening): each iteration's read
    size is capped at ``min(_READ_CHUNK_SIZE, limit - total + 1)``. The
    ``+1`` reserves one byte to detect overshoot at the boundary without
    accepting it. Maximum precision deviation is therefore 1 byte (the

    ~64 KB (one full chunk past the cap before the check fired). The
