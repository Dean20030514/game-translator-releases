"""Translation DB — store per-line translation metadata for incremental workflows.

Thread-safety: all mutating and reading operations are guarded by a re-entrant
lock so that concurrent workers (e.g. ``engines/generic_pipeline.py`` running
``translation_db.upsert_entry`` from a ``ThreadPoolExecutor``) cannot corrupt
``self.entries`` / ``self._index``.

Durability: ``save()`` writes atomically via a temp file + ``os.replace`` so a
mid-write crash or Windows file-handle contention cannot leave a half-written
JSON payload on disk.

Incremental writes: a ``_dirty`` flag short-circuits ``save()`` when nothing
has changed since the last successful persist (previously every pipeline
report path re-serialised the entire DB regardless of changes).

Round 52 C4 BREAKING: schema v2 (round 34 multi-language ``language`` field
+ 4-tuple ``(file, line, original, language)`` index) retired.  Reverted to
v1 flat schema: 3-tuple ``(file, line, original)`` index, no per-entry
``language`` field.  Existing v2 DBs must be migrated via
``scripts/migrate_db_v2_to_v1.py``.
